# uwp-app-removal

A PowerShell tool that takes inventory of installed Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications and provides an option to delete those apps. Windows 10 comes with many preinstalled (built-in) UWP apps, including some that don't have an obvious means of removing. My goal was to create a PowerShell tool that would allow me to catalog all UWP apps and remove them one-by-one or en masse, based on menu option choices.

This was created as a proof-of-concept tool as well as a PowerShell learning exercise. This tool has not been recently maintained and is only semi-functional. I encountered some issues with the tool that have yet to be resolved.

There are two versions of this tool that have been included in this repository. Each attempt utilizes different PowerShell code but both are attempts at reaching the same functional goal.
